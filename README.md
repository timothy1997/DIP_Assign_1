Data Image Processing Assignment #1

The goal of assignment #1 was simply to get me familiar to opencv. So what I was asked to do and did was to create an opencv application that could display an image, and where ever the cursor was over the image, is would display the rgb values of the pixal at the cursor, along with its x-y coordinates. So not much to it. Feel free to look at the code, there's not much there and it's pretty basic, and the code is probably not the best way to achieve that task, but if it helps you for any reason. Great!
